CoachBoard
CoachBoard is a web application designed for basketball coaches to track their players performances during games. The app allows coaches to add players, record performance stats (such as points, assists, rebounds, etc.) for each game, and display them in a table. Coaches can filter performance data by player, game, or date and see overall team and individual statistics.
